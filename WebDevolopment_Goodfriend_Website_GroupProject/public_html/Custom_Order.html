                "If you know what you like, and know what you do not, then this option is for you. <br>
                Our Custom Plan let you customize any main courses you wish, as well as a range of breakfasts and salads for snacks. <br>
                Life is too short to eat food you do not like (and even shorter if that food is not good for you), but when you can choose a healthy, delicious diet everyday, <br>
                you will agree that life is much more enjoyable." <br>
