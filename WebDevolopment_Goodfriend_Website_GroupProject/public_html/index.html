                Three different messages, varying in content and emphasis, were used to promote one food special each <br>
                intervention day. One message emphasized that the specials were particularly healthful, being relatively <br>
                low in fat, sodium, and cholesterol. A second message stressed flavor and added that the choice was healthful. <br>

                than its healthfulness. <b> WE CONSIDER THOSE FACTS AND DELIVER! </b><br>
